# RES-Continuous-Music-Extension
*This is currently in early development and non-functional.*
- iFrame's do not allow cross-domain click events, so I'm researching a way to trigger actually playing music players and videos.
- This may be accomplishable through Cross-Origin XMLHttpRequests

## Goal
The Goal of this extension is to simulate a radio-type experience on music subreddits.

## Branches
- no_chrome_api: This branch opens up a new tab by grabbing the url from each thread title.
